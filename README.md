i don't find any kamigotchi player share a kami finder they built, so i practiced some ui concepts and here to publish it

check this open source full onchain game if interested in:
https://github.com/Asphodel-OS/kamigotchi

for now i only want to make it a static site, and it will update in 30min if there're new kami ♡
