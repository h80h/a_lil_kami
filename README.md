i don't find any kamigotchi player share a kami finder they built, so i practiced some ui concepts and here to publish it

check this open source full onchain game if interested in:
https://github.com/Asphodel-OS/kamigotchi

for now i only know how to copy data from browser console, so this project can't show the latest minted kamigotchi nft any time, but i will try to update once a day, i love kamigotchi world ♡
